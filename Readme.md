# promise

  > It feelds good to reinvent the wheel

  Promises implementation based on [emitter](htp://github.com/component/emitter). It follows [A+ spec](http://promises-aplus.github.io/promises-spec/).

## Installation

  Install with [component](http://component.io):

    $ component install bredele/promise

  Install with [nodejs](http://nodejs.orh):

    $ npm install component-promise

## API

### .then(fulfilled, rejected)

 Register callbacks to receive either a promiseâ€™s eventual value or the reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled .

```js
promise.then(function() {
  //on fulfilled
}, function() {
  //on rejected
});
```

 `then` arguments are optionals

### .resolve(value)

 Resolve/Fulfill promise with optional value.

```js
promise.resolve();
```

### .reject(reason)

 Reject promise with optional reason.

```js
promise.reject();
```

### .state

 Promise state is `pending` by default and may transition to either the `fulfilled` or `rejected` state.
 A promise which is `fulfilled` or `rejected` can not transition to another state.

```js
promise.state;
```

 `state` is private and should not be changed outside of the [`resolve`](#resolve) or [`reject`](#reject) handlers.
