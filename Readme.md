Ridiculously small and powerful **promise** implementation based on the [A+ spec](/test).

* **Interoperable**: Bluff does not deal with how to create, fulfill, or reject promises, choosing instead to focus on providing an interoperable `then` method.
* **Combination**: Bluff allows you to elegantly combine multiple promises into a promise that is resolved when all of the input promises are resolved.
* **Standardization**: Bluff helps reducing difference of implementation in your code according you are dealing with synchronous or asynchronous computations. Any value passed to Bluff is transformed into a promise.

## Usage

```js
var Promise = require('bluff')

function readJSON(filename){
  return new Promise(function (fulfill, reject){
    readFile(filename, 'utf8').done(function (res){
      try {
        fulfill(JSON.parse(res));
      } catch (ex) {
        reject(ex);
      }
    }, reject);
  });
}

readJSON('package.json').then(data => doSomething(data))
```
